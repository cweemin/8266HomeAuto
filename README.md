# 8266HomeAuto

This is a project to use ESP8266 to automate stuff around my house. This includes:
  - Detect thermometer/hygrometer data from an outdoor Accurite sensor.
  - Detect pool thermometer from a pool floating sensor
  - Send On/Off signal wirelessly to few 315Mhz remote switch around the house.

TODO:
  - Add authentication maybe for public use.
